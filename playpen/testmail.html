     THE PROLOGUE.
     <br>
     <br>
      ["YEA, let that passe," quoth our Host, "as now.
     <br>
      Sir Doctor of Physik, I praye you,
     <br>
      Tell us a tale of some honest mattere."
     <br>
      "It shall be done, if that ye will it hear,"
     <br>
      Said this Doctor; and his tale gan anon.
     <br>
      "Now, good men," quoth he, "hearken everyone."]
     <br>
     <br>
      THE TALE.
     <br>
     <br>
      There was, as telleth Titus Livius,
     <br>
      A knight, that called was Virginius,
     <br>
      Full filled of honour and worthiness,
     <br>
      And strong of friendes, and of great richess.
     <br>
      This knight one daughter hadde by his wife;
     <br>
      No children had he more in all his life.
     <br>
      Fair was this maid in excellent beauty
     <br>
      Aboven ev'ry wight that man may see:
     <br>
      For nature had with sov'reign diligence
     <br>
      Y-formed her in so great excellence,
     <br>
      As though she woulde say, "Lo, I, Nature,
     <br>
      Thus can I form and paint a creature,
     <br>
      When that me list; who can me counterfeit?
     <br>
      Pygmalion? not though he aye forge and beat,
     <br>
      Or grave or painte: for I dare well sayn,
     <br>
      Apelles, Zeuxis, shoulde work in vain,
     <br>
      Either to grave, or paint, or forge, or beat,
     <br>
      If they presumed me to counterfeit.
     <br>
      For he that is the former principal,
     <br>
      Hath made me his vicar-general
     <br>
      To form and painten earthly creatures
     <br>
      Right as me list, and all thing in my cure is,
     <br>
      Under the moone, that may wane and wax.
     <br>
      And for my work right nothing will I ax
     <br>
      My lord and I be full of one accord.
     <br>
      I made her to the worship of my lord;
     <br>
      So do I all mine other creatures,
     <br>
      What colour that they have, or what figures."
     <br>
      Thus seemeth me that Nature woulde say.
     <br>
     <br>
      This maiden was of age twelve year and tway,
     <br>
      In which that Nature hadde such delight.
     <br>
      For right as she can paint a lily white,
     <br>
      And red a rose, right with such painture
     <br>
      She painted had this noble creature,
     <br>
      Ere she was born, upon her limbes free,
     <br>
      Where as by right such colours shoulde be:
     <br>
      And Phoebus dyed had her tresses great,
     <br>
      Like to the streames of his burned heat.
     <br>
      And if that excellent was her beauty,
     <br>
      A thousand-fold more virtuous was she.
     <br>
      In her there lacked no condition,
     <br>
      That is to praise, as by discretion.
     <br>
      As well in ghost as body chaste was she:
     <br>
      For which she flower'd in virginity,
     <br>
      With all humility and abstinence,
     <br>
      With alle temperance and patience,
     <br>
      With measure eke of bearing and array.
     <br>
      Discreet she was in answering alway,
     <br>
      Though she were wise as Pallas, dare I sayn;
     <br>
      Her faconde eke full womanly and plain,
     <br>
      No counterfeited termes hadde she
     <br>
      To seeme wise; but after her degree
     <br>
      She spake, and all her worde's more and less
     <br>
      Sounding in virtue and in gentleness.
     <br>
      Shamefast she was in maiden's shamefastness,
     <br>
      Constant in heart, and ever in business
     <br>
      To drive her out of idle sluggardy:
     <br>
      Bacchus had of her mouth right no mast'ry.
     <br>
      For wine and slothe do Venus increase,
     <br>
      As men in fire will casten oil and grease.
     <br>
      And of her owen virtue, unconstrain'd,
     <br>
      She had herself full often sick y-feign'd,
     <br>
      For that she woulde flee the company,
     <br>
      Where likely was to treaten of folly,
     <br>
      As is at feasts, at revels, and at dances,
     <br>
      That be occasions of dalliances.
     <br>
      Such thinges make children for to be
     <br>
      Too soone ripe and bold, as men may see,
     <br>
      Which is full perilous, and hath been yore;
     <br>
      For all too soone may she learne lore
     <br>
      Of boldeness, when that she is a wife.
     <br>
     <br>
      And ye mistresses, in your olde life
     <br>
      That lordes' daughters have in governance,
     <br>
      Take not of my wordes displeasance
     <br>
      Thinke that ye be set in governings
     <br>
      Of lordes' daughters only for two things;
     <br>
      Either for ye have kept your honesty,
     <br>
      Or else for ye have fallen in frailty
     <br>
      And knowe well enough the olde dance,
     <br>
      And have forsaken fully such meschance
     <br>
      For evermore; therefore, for Christe's sake,
     <br>
      To teach them virtue look that ye not slake.
     <br>
      A thief of venison, that hath forlaft
     <br>
      His lik'rousness, and all his olde craft,
     <br>
      Can keep a forest best of any man;
     <br>
      Now keep them well, for if ye will ye can.
     <br>
      Look well, that ye unto no vice assent,
     <br>
      Lest ye be damned for your wick' intent,
     <br>
      For whoso doth, a traitor is certain;
     <br>
      And take keep of that I shall you sayn;
     <br>
      Of alle treason, sov'reign pestilence
     <br>
      Is when a wight betrayeth innocence.
     <br>
      Ye fathers, and ye mothers eke also,
     <br>
      Though ye have children, be it one or mo',
     <br>
      Yours is the charge of all their surveyance,
     <br>
      While that they be under your governance.
     <br>
      Beware, that by example of your living,
     <br>
      Or by your negligence in chastising,
     <br>
      That they not perish for I dare well say,
     <br>
      If that they do, ye shall it dear abeye.
     <br>
      Under a shepherd soft and negligent
     <br>
      The wolf hath many a sheep and lamb to-rent.
     <br>
      Suffice this example now as here,
     <br>
      For I must turn again to my mattere.
     <br>
     <br>
      This maid, of which I tell my tale express,
     <br>
      She kept herself, her needed no mistress;
     <br>
      For in her living maidens mighte read,
     <br>
      As in a book, ev'ry good word and deed
     <br>
      That longeth to a maiden virtuous;
     <br>
      She was so prudent and so bounteous.
     <br>
      For which the fame out sprang on every side
     <br>
      Both of her beauty and her bounte wide:
     <br>
      That through the land they praised her each one
     <br>
      That loved virtue, save envy alone,
     <br>
      That sorry is of other manne's weal,
     <br>
      And glad is of his sorrow and unheal --
     <br>
      The Doctor maketh this descriptioun. --
     <br>
      This maiden on a day went in the town
     <br>
      Toward a temple, with her mother dear,
     <br>
      As is of younge maidens the mannere.
     <br>
      Now was there then a justice in that town,
     <br>
      That governor was of that regioun:
     <br>
      And so befell, this judge his eyen cast
     <br>
      Upon this maid, avising her full fast,
     <br>
      As she came forth by where this judge stood;
     <br>
      Anon his hearte changed and his mood,
     <br>
      So was he caught with beauty of this maid
     <br>
      And to himself full privily he said,
     <br>
      "This maiden shall be mine for any man."
     <br>
      Anon the fiend into his hearte ran,
     <br>
      And taught him suddenly, that he by sleight
     <br>
      This maiden to his purpose winne might.
     <br>
      For certes, by no force, nor by no meed,
     <br>
      Him thought he was not able for to speed;
     <br>
      For she was strong of friendes, and eke she
     <br>
      Confirmed was in such sov'reign bounte,
     <br>
      That well he wist he might her never win,
     <br>
      As for to make her with her body sin.
     <br>
      For which, with great deliberatioun,
     <br>
      He sent after a clerk was in the town,
     <br>
      The which he knew for subtle and for bold.
     <br>
      This judge unto this clerk his tale told
     <br>
      In secret wise, and made him to assure
     <br>
      He shoulde tell it to no creature,
     <br>
      And if he did, he shoulde lose his head.
     <br>
      And when assented was this cursed rede,
     <br>
      Glad was the judge, and made him greate cheer,
     <br>
      And gave him giftes precious and dear.
     <br>
      When shapen was all their conspiracy
     <br>
      From point to point, how that his lechery
     <br>
      Performed shoulde be full subtilly,
     <br>
      As ye shall hear it after openly,
     <br>
      Home went this clerk, that highte Claudius.
     <br>
      This false judge, that highte Appius, --
     <br>
      (So was his name, for it is no fable,
     <br>
      But knowen for a storial thing notable;
     <br>
      The sentence of it sooth is out of doubt); --
     <br>
      This false judge went now fast about
     <br>
      To hasten his delight all that he may.
     <br>
      And so befell, soon after on a day,
     <br>
      This false judge, as telleth us the story,
     <br>
      As he was wont, sat in his consistory,
     <br>
      And gave his doomes upon sundry case';
     <br>
      This false clerk came forth a full great pace,
     <br>
      And saide; Lord, if that it be your will,
     <br>
      As do me right upon this piteous bill,
     <br>
      In which I plain upon Virginius.
     <br>
      And if that he will say it is not thus,
     <br>
      I will it prove, and finde good witness,
     <br>
      That sooth is what my bille will express."
     <br>
      The judge answer'd, "Of this, in his absence,
     <br>
      I may not give definitive sentence.
     <br>
      Let do him call, and I will gladly hear;
     <br>
      Thou shalt have alle right, and no wrong here."
     <br>
      Virginius came to weet the judge's will,
     <br>
      And right anon was read this cursed bill;
     <br>
      The sentence of it was as ye shall hear
     <br>
      "To you, my lord, Sir Appius so clear,
     <br>
      Sheweth your poore servant Claudius,
     <br>
      How that a knight called Virginius,
     <br>
      Against the law, against all equity,
     <br>
      Holdeth, express against the will of me,
     <br>
      My servant, which that is my thrall by right,
     <br>
      Which from my house was stolen on a night,
     <br>
      While that she was full young; I will it preve
     <br>
      By witness, lord, so that it you not grieve;
     <br>
      She is his daughter not, what so he say.
     <br>
      Wherefore to you, my lord the judge, I pray,
     <br>
      Yield me my thrall, if that it be your will."
     <br>
      Lo, this was all the sentence of the bill.
     <br>
      Virginius gan upon the clerk behold;
     <br>
      But hastily, ere he his tale told,
     <br>
      And would have proved it, as should a knight,
     <br>
      And eke by witnessing of many a wight,
     <br>
      That all was false that said his adversary,
     <br>
      This cursed judge would no longer tarry,
     <br>
      Nor hear a word more of Virginius,
     <br>
      But gave his judgement, and saide thus:
     <br>
      "I deem anon this clerk his servant have;
     <br>
      Thou shalt no longer in thy house her save.
     <br>
      Go, bring her forth, and put her in our ward
     <br>
      The clerk shall have his thrall: thus I award."
     <br>
     <br>
      And when this worthy knight, Virginius,
     <br>
      Through sentence of this justice Appius,
     <br>
      Muste by force his deare daughter give
     <br>
      Unto the judge, in lechery to live,
     <br>
      He went him home, and sat him in his hall,
     <br>
      And let anon his deare daughter call;
     <br>
      And with a face dead as ashes cold
     <br>
      Upon her humble face he gan behold,
     <br>
      With father's pity sticking through his heart,
     <br>
      All would he from his purpose not convert.
     <br>
      "Daughter," quoth he, "Virginia by name,
     <br>
      There be two wayes, either death or shame,
     <br>
      That thou must suffer, -- alas that I was bore!
     <br>
      For never thou deservedest wherefore
     <br>
      To dien with a sword or with a knife,
     <br>
      O deare daughter, ender of my life,
     <br>
      Whom I have foster'd up with such pleasance
     <br>
      That thou were ne'er out of my remembrance;
     <br>
      O daughter, which that art my laste woe,
     <br>
      And in this life my laste joy also,
     <br>
      O gem of chastity, in patience
     <br>
      Take thou thy death, for this is my sentence:
     <br>
      For love and not for hate thou must be dead;
     <br>
      My piteous hand must smiten off thine head.
     <br>
      Alas, that ever Appius thee say!
     <br>
      Thus hath he falsely judged thee to-day."
     <br>
      And told her all the case, as ye before
     <br>
      Have heard; it needeth not to tell it more.
     <br>
     <br>
      "O mercy, deare father," quoth the maid.
     <br>
      And with that word she both her armes laid
     <br>
      About his neck, as she was wont to do,
     <br>
      (The teares burst out of her eyen two),
     <br>
      And said, "O goode father, shall I die?
     <br>
      Is there no grace? is there no remedy?"
     <br>
      "No, certes, deare daughter mine," quoth he.
     <br>
      "Then give me leisure, father mine, quoth she,
     <br>
      "My death for to complain a little space
     <br>
      For, pardie, Jephthah gave his daughter grace
     <br>
      For to complain, ere he her slew, alas!
     <br>
      And, God it wot, nothing was her trespass,
     <br>
      But for she ran her father first to see,
     <br>
      To welcome him with great solemnity."
     <br>
      And with that word she fell a-swoon anon;
     <br>
      And after, when her swooning was y-gone,
     <br>
      She rose up, and unto her father said:
     <br>
      "Blessed be God, that I shall die a maid.
     <br>
      Give me my death, ere that I have shame;
     <br>
      Do with your child your will, in Godde's name."
     <br>
      And with that word she prayed him full oft
     <br>
      That with his sword he woulde smite her soft;
     <br>
      And with that word, a-swoon again she fell.
     <br>
      Her father, with full sorrowful heart and fell,
     <br>
      Her head off smote, and by the top it hent,
     <br>
      And to the judge he went it to present,
     <br>
      As he sat yet in doom in consistory.
     <br>
     <br>
      And when the judge it saw, as saith the story,
     <br>
      He bade to take him, and to hang him fast.
     <br>
      But right anon a thousand people in thrast
     <br>
      To save the knight, for ruth and for pity
     <br>
      For knowen was the false iniquity.
     <br>
      The people anon had suspect in this thing,
     <br>
      By manner of the clerke's challenging,
     <br>
      That it was by th'assent of Appius;
     <br>
      They wiste well that he was lecherous.
     <br>
      For which unto this Appius they gon,
     <br>
      And cast him in a prison right anon,
     <br>
      Where as he slew himself: and Claudius,
     <br>
      That servant was unto this Appius,
     <br>
      Was doomed for to hang upon a tree;
     <br>
      But that Virginius, of his pity,
     <br>
      So prayed for him, that he was exil'd;
     <br>
      And elles certes had he been beguil'd;
     <br>
      The remenant were hanged, more and less,
     <br>
      That were consenting to this cursedness.
     <br>
      Here men may see how sin hath his merite:
     <br>
      Beware, for no man knows how God will smite
     <br>
      In no degree, nor in which manner wise
     <br>
      The worm of conscience may agrise
     <br>
      Of wicked life, though it so privy be,
     <br>
      That no man knows thereof, save God and he;
     <br>
      For be he lewed man or elles lear'd,
     <br>
      He knows not how soon he shall be afear'd;
     <br>
      Therefore I rede you this counsel take,
     <br>
      Forsake sin, ere sinne you forsake.
